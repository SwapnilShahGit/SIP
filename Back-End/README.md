# Back-End Team
This folder contains the code from the Back-End team. Our current goal is to implement the parser with use of either Java or Python. 
This parser will be the back-bone of the entire project as it will need to work with a high level of accuracy for better user experience. Future goals will include 
1. Set up a server that will accept requests from the front-end and potential mobile applications 
2. Google Calendar API Integration
3. Establish a database to store user information and syllabus
4. A smarter system that will detect if the information from a specific syllabus has already been parsed (similar to a dictionary)

The Back-End team consists of: 

Darren Hobin (Darren.Hobin@soti.net)

Pranali Rathi (Pranali.Rathi@soti.net)

Swapnil Shah (Swapnil.Shah@soti.net)
