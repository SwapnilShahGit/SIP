# Back-End Team
This folder contains the code from the Back-End team. Our current goal is to implement the parser with use of either Java or Python. 
This parser will be the back-bone of the entire project as it will need to work with a high level of accuracy for better user experience.

The Back-End team consists of: 

Darren Hobin (Darren.Hobin@soti.net)

Pranali Rathi (Pranali.Rathi@soti.net)

Swapnil Shah (Swapnil.Shah@soti.net)
