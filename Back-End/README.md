# Back-End Team
This folder contains our code. Our main goal is to implement the parser with use of either Java and/or Python. 
This parser will be the primary focus of the entire project as it will need to work with a high level of accuracy for a better user experience. We have included a high level to-do list for this project below.

| Goals                                                                                                                           |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Finish a basic version of the parser that works with 10 sample syllabi from UTM                                                 |
| Set up a server that will accept requests from the front-end and potential mobile applications                                  |
| Google Calendar API Integration using CalDev                                                                                    |
| Establish a database to store user information and manage the existing syllabus                                                 |
| A smarter system that will detect if the information from a specific syllabus has already been parsed (similar to a dictionary) |
| Ensure the parser works with 10 sample syllabi from UofT St.George                                                              |
| Ensure the parser works with syllabi from any university in Canada                                                              |  
| Support multiple types of documents (.pdf, .word, .txt, .html)                                                                  |
