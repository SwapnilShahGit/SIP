# Back-End Team
</p>
This folder contains our code. Our current goal is to implement the parser with use of either Java and/or Python. 
This parser will be the back-bone of the entire project as it will need to work with a high level of accuracy for better user experience. Future goals include:   
1. Set up a server that will accept requests from the front-end and potential mobile applications   
2. Google Calendar API Integration  
3. Establish a database to store user information and manage the existing syllabus  
4. A smarter system that will detect if the information from a specific syllabus has already been parsed (similar to a dictionary)  

The Back-End team consists of: 

Darren Hobin (Darren.Hobin@soti.net)
