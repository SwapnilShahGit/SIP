Procedures and Rules
Missed Term Work
For missed work, contact the instructor by email within 24 hours of the due date of the work. However, it is far easier to negotiate
an accommodation well before the due date, so please inform the instructor as soon as you are aware that accommodation will be
required.
Documentation of the reason for requesting accommodation is necessary. For illness, be prepared to submit a UofT medical
certificate. For other reasons, the instructor will request a relevant form of evidence.
Missed Final Exam
Students who cannot write a final examination due to illness or other serious causes must file an online petition within 72 hours of
the missed examination. Original supporting documentation must also be submitted to the Office of the Registrar within 72 hours
of the missed exam. Late petitions will NOT be considered. If illness is cited as the reason for a deferred exam request, a U of T
Medical Certificate must show that you were examined and diagnosed at the time of illness and on the date of the exam, or by
the day after at the latest. Students must also record their absence on ROSI on the day of the missed exam or by the day after at
the latest. Upon approval of a deferred exam request, a non-refundable fee of $70 is required for each examination approved.
Academic Integrity
Honesty and fairness are fundamental to the University of Torontoâ€™s mission. Plagiarism is a form of academic fraud and is treated
very seriously. The work that you submit must be your own and cannot contain anyone elses work or ideas without proper
attribution. You are expected to read the handout How not to plagiarize (http://www.writing.utoronto.ca/advice/using-sources/how-
not-to-plagiarize) and to be familiar with the Code of behaviour on academic matters, which is linked from the UTM calendar under
the link Codes and policies.
