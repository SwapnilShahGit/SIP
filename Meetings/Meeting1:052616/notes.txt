In this meeting, we decided between Pinterest for Sports and the syllabus parser. This decision had to be made as the google forms vote had turned out to be 50/50 with an exception to the one vote that voted for the third option (Inventory Counter). After much discussion and debating, we decided on the syllabus parser.

P.S. We need to remember to clean off the whiteboard after the meeting to keep everything private
