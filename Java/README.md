# The Parser
This folder contains my code for the Parser. My main goal is to implement the parser with Java with the help of existing API's provided by the open source community. The goal is to obtain the available information given to us by the API's and then parse the rest from the syllabus given to me by the user.

| Current Tasks                                                                                                                   |

| ~Pdf to Text conversion~                                                                  |
| look for anomalies in the pdf (things that might be wrong with the formatting)           |
| ~save raw string~                                                                          |
| ~go through different date formats and find the relevant dates in the document~            |
| search around the date to find relevant information about the date                       |
| ~generate an object that has attributes of the found characteristics~                      |
| ~Identify the date and information given~                                                  |
| Process information in JSON                                                              |
| send JSON back to the node team                                                          |
| potentially create a public API                                                          |


| End Goals                                                                                                                       |

| Finish a basic version of the parser that works with all UofT campuses                                                          |
| Set up a RESTful API for potential mobile application usage                                                                     |
| Ensure the parser works with syllabi from any university in Canada                                                              |  
| Support multiple types of documents (.pdf, .word, .txt, .html)                                                                  |
| Have a clean code base that is readable and follows the java software development principles|
