Students must present their case to the Department (NOT the Instructor) \nby submitting a request via the online Special Consideration Request form at: \nhttps:\/\/utmapp.utm.utoronto.ca\/SpecialRequest.  \nStudents are to submit original supporting documentation (e.g., medical certificates, accident reports, etc.) to the \nPsychology Academic Counselor or drop it in the drop box located outside the Psychology office, Deerfield Hall, 4th Floor. \nStudents have up-to one week from the date of the missed test to submit request. Late submissions will NOT be \nconsidered without a letter of explanation specifying and documenting the reasons for the lateness.  \nMedical certificates or physician\u2019s notes must be completed by the Physician and MUST include the statement \"This \nStudent [name] was unable to write the test on [date(s)] for medical reasons\". This documentation must show that the \nphysician was consulted within one the day of the missed term test. A statement merely acknowledging a report of \nillness made by the student to the physician is NOT acceptable. For further information on this procedure please see: \nhttp:\/\/www.utm.utoronto.ca\/psychology\/undergraduate-studies\/missed-testslate-submissions  \nIf you missed your test\/assignment deadline for a reason connected to your registered disability, please be advised that \nthe department will accept documentation supplied by the UTM AccessAbility Resource Centre.  \nIMPORTANT: The Department of Psychology verifies the authenticity of medical certificates by contacting medical \noffices. Students are NOT to make any changes or alteration to completed medical certificates. Students who submit \nforged or altered documentation are subject to severe academic penalties.  \nIf your request is approved by the department, the value of the test will be redistributed to the final examination. \nExtension of Time Special Consideration Request Process \nStudents who seek to be granted more time to complete their term work beyond the due date without penalty, owing to \ncircumstances beyond their control (e.g., illness, or an accident), must do so by submitting a request directly to the \nInstructor for the period up to and including the last day of the term. The decision as to whether or not to apply a \npenalty for the specified period rests with the Instructor.  \nStudents who seek to be granted more time to complete term work beyond the last day of the term must submit their \nrequest directly to the Department. This request covers the period following the last day of classes and ends the last day \nof the exam period. This is done by submitting a request via the online Special Consideration Request form at \nhttps:\/\/utmapp.utm.utoronto.ca\/SpecialRequest.   \nYou are advised to seek advising by the departmental Undergraduate Counsellor prior to the deadline.  \nOriginal supporting documentation (e.g., medical certificates, accident reports, etc.) must be submitted to the \nPsychology Academic Counselor or dropped off in the drop box located outside the Psychology office Deerfield Hall, 4th \nFloor. Students are expected to submit requests to the Department before the last day of the term, unless demonstrably \nserious reasons prevent them from doing so. In the event of an illness, medical certificates or doctor\u2019s notes must \nconfirm that student was ill on the due date of the assignment (for a one-day extension). For a longer extension, \ndocumentation must specify the full duration during which academic work could not be carried out.  \nFor extensions of time beyond the examination period you must submit a petition through the Office of the Registrar. \nhttp:\/\/www.utm.utoronto.ca\/registrar\/current-students\/petitions  \nFall 2016 - Department of Psychology  Page 3 \nPenalties for Lateness  \nA penalty of 10% per calendar day (i.e., including week-ends and holidays, during which students are not able to submit \nterm work) up to and including the last day of classes, will be applied by the Instructor. After the last day of classes, the \npenalty of 10% per calendar day will be applied by the Undergraduate Counsellor on behalf of the Department. No \npenalty will be assigned if request for special consideration, described above, was successful. \nAcademic Guidelines  \nIt is your responsibility to ensure that you have met all prerequisites listed in the UTM Calendar for this course. If you \nlack any prerequisites you WILL BE REMOVED from the course up until the last day to add a course.

When students are suspected of \ncheating or a similar academic offence, they are typically surprised at how formally and seriously the matter is dealt with \n-- and how severe the consequences can be if it is determined that cheating did occur. The University of Toronto treats \ncases of cheating and plagiarism very seriously.

Wherever in the Code an offence is described as depending \non \"knowing\u201D, the offence shall likewise be deemed to have been committed if the person ought reasonably to have \nknown.\u201D All students must refer to this website to obtain information on what constitutes plagiarism. \nhttp:\/\/www.writing.utoronto.ca\/advice\/using-sources\/how-not-to-plagiarize.   \nIf questions arise after reading the material on the website, consult your instructor.   \nPlagiarism will not be tolerated.  \n \n \nFall 2016 - Department of Psychology  Page 4 \nEquity Statement \nThe University of Toronto is committed to equity and respect for diversity.
