[36L,\r\n12T]\r\nPrerequisite: Minimum 70% in Grade 12 Advanced Functions (MHF4U)\r\nExclusion: MAT138H1,246H1,CSC165H1\r\nRecommended: Minimum 70% in Grade 12 Calculus and Vectors (MCV4U) (SCI) \r\nDistribution Requirement: SCI \r\nStudents who lack a pre\/co-requisite can be removed at any time unless received explicit waiver from department.\r\nTextbooks and Other Materials\r\nRegarding the textbook you have the following two options available:\r\nOption 1: If you are planning on taking  both MAT 102 and MAT 202, then you need to buy the full text: \r\nMathematical Thinking: Problem-Solving and Proofs, 2nd Edition by D'Angelo and West\r\nOption 2: If you are NOT planning to take MAT202, then buy the custom edition of the above mentioned textbook. It is available in\r\nsoft cover at the UTM bookstore. The custom edition will contain only chapters covered in MAT102 course.  \r\n \r\nNOTE: Calculators are not needed for this course, and will not be allowed during quizzes, tests and exams.\r\n \r\n \r\nAssessment and Deadlines\r\nMore Details for Assessment and Deadlines\r\nProblem Sets\r\nProblem sets will be posted on the course website every week, and will cover the recent material discussed in lectures. You are\r\nexpected to work on the questions assigned, and if you cannot solve a problem, you should ask your TA and\/or the instructor for\r\nhelp. You will submit Problem Sets B,D,F,G and I to your TA for grading. The other problem sets will NOT be submitted for\r\ngrading, but you will be tested on the material they cover on a quiz, test or exam (see the course schedule below).\r\nYou are encouraged to work with your fellow students while working on questions from the problem sets. However, the writing of\r\nyour assignment must be done without any assistance whatsoever.\r\nYour problem set mark will be determined by taking the average of the best four problem sets.\r\nNote: If a problem set is to be submitted for grading, submit  one copy of your work to your TA at the beginning of the tutorial\r\non the week it is due, and in the tutorial you are registered in.\r\n \r\nQuizzes and Term Test\r\nThere will be four quizzes and one term test. See the course schedule below for dates, times, location and material for each\r\nquiz\/term test. More details about the term test and the quizzes will be given later. You must bring your student card to the term\r\ntest and to each quiz.\r\nYour quizzes mark will be determined by taking the average of the best three quizzes.\r\nNote: There are no makeup quizzes! If you miss one quiz due to illness, you do not need to submit a medical note, since only the\r\nbest three quizzes will count. If you miss more than one quiz, you will have to provide proper documentation to the course\r\ncoordinator (Marina Tvalavadze) and your marking scheme will be adjusted.\r\nMAT102H5F - Tvalavadze, Marina Page 2 of 4\r\n \r\nPenalties for Lateness\r\nMissing a Problem Set\r\nLate Problem Sets will not be accepted for marking.\r\n \r\nProcedures and Rules\r\nMissed Term Work\r\nMissing a Quiz\r\nThere are no makeup quizzes! If you miss one quiz due to illness, you do not need to submit a medical note, since only the best\r\nthree quizzes will count.\r\nIf you miss more than one quiz, you will have to provide proper documentation to the course coordinator (Marina Tvalavadze) and\r\nyour marking scheme will be adjusted.\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nMissing the Term Test\r\nIf you cannot show up for the test because of illness or any other special reason, you should declare your absence on ROSI and\r\nsubmit your documentation to the course coordinator (Marina Tvalavadze) no later than one week after the day of the test (for\r\nmedical notes, you must use the Offi \u200Bcial Verification of Student Illness or Injury form, which can be downloaded from the\r\ncourse website).\r\nThere will be no make-up tests. The course coordinator will adjust the marking scheme properly for students who have missed the\r\ntest because of illness or any other (approved) legitimate reason.\r\n \r\nMissed Final Exam\r\nStudents who cannot write a final examination due to illness or other serious causes must file an online petition within 72 hours of\r\nthe missed examination. Original supporting documentation must also be submitted to the Office of the Registrar within 72 hours\r\nof the missed exam. Late petitions will NOT be considered. If illness is cited as the reason for a deferred exam request, a U of T\r\nVerification of Student Illness or Injury Form must show that you were examined and diagnosed at the time of illness and on the\r\ndate of the exam, or by the day after at the latest. Students must also record their absence on ACORN on the day of the missed\r\nexam or by the day after at the latest. Upon approval of a deferred exam request, a non-refundable fee of $70 is required for each\r\nexamination approved.\r\nAcademic Integrity\r\nHonesty and fairness are fundamental to the University of Toronto\u2019s mission. Plagiarism is a form of academic fraud and is treated\r\nvery seriously. The work that you submit must be your own and cannot contain anyone elses work or ideas without proper\r\nattribution. You are expected to read the handout How not to plagiarize (http:\/\/www.writing.utoronto.ca\/advice\/using-sources\/how-\r\nnot-to-plagiarize) and to be familiar with the Code of behaviour on academic matters, which is linked from the UTM calendar under\r\nthe link Codes and policies.\r\nFinal Exam Information\r\nDuration: 2 hours\r\nAids Permitted: None\r\nAdditional Information\r\nTutorials\r\nThere are several tutorial groups in the course. Each student must be registered in one of the tutorials (on ROSI), and attend it\r\nregularly every week. Details regarding the day, time and location of your tutorial are available online, at\r\nhttps:\/\/registrar.utm.utoronto.ca\/student\/timetable\/. In tutorials, you will have the opportunity to work on problems and get help and\r\nguidance from your TA. Occasionally, the TA will review some of the material discussed in the lectures, and will present solutions\r\nto homework problems. Tutorials will begin on the week of January 12 (second week of classes).\r\nNote: Students can register to any of the tutorials, regardless of the lecture section in which they are registered. \r\nMAT102H5F - Tvalavadze, Marina Page 3 of 4\r\nWeek of   \r\n1 September 6 Classes begin.
